This is it, the maiden voyage of the blog/site/whatever this is. I got an itch to finally do something with one of the many ill-advised domains I've had racking up yearly charges on my credit card, and I've been wanting to pick up one of these static site generators for a bit too. The perfect storm to reach this particular point and branch in the timeline. I imagine that there are two parallel universes, one in which I don't make this and one in which I do, and I have to apologize for putting you into the second (and likely worse) of the two.

Anyway, here we are. This site exists, and in all likelihood won't see a ton of action but you never know, late night ramblings are kinda fun now and again. Onward into overnight internet virality and wild and inconceivable success. :tada:
